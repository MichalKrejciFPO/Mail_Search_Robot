Mail Search Robot

Automatic robot traversing the tree structures of www servers and all links from them. Searches and stores found e-mail addresses. It can search up to several thousand addresses per hour, depending on the speed of internet connectivity and processor performance. A number of parameters allow you to limit the group of browsed www servers, their domains and the structure of searched addresses.

The attached screenshot shows the application running in search mode.
